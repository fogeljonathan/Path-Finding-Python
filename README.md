# Path-Finding-Python
A simple A* path finding game. Select start and end nodes, and create walls to block the path. Watch the program figure out the most optimal path. The algorithm prefers paths that are direct and diagonal. 

Packages needed:
1. Pygame

This file is a alteration of @Tech-With-Tim 's version of the game. He also runs a youtube channel at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4JX40jDee_tINbkjycV4Sg! One change made is with the algorithm's preferred route. By using a Euclidean calculation of H, the new program generally prefers more direct paths, as opposed to long "L" shaped paths.
