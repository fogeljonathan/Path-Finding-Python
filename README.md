# Path-Finding-Python
A simple A* path finding game. Select start and end nodes, and create walls to block the path. Watch the program figure out the most optimal path.

Packages used:
1. Pygame

This file is a alteration of @Tech-With-Tim 's version of the game. One change is with the algorithm's preferred route. By using a Euclidean calculation of H, the new program generally prefers more direct paths, as opposed to long sequences with right angles between them.

Feel free to use/alter as you see fit.
